# Tandemloop Screening Test

**Name:** Nilesh Das
**Programming Language:** Java (JDK 21)

### Description
Here are the solution for the all thye 4 problems

### My understanding for the problems

**Problem 1 (Calculator):**
- I used the  `switch` statement for the arithmetic operatiopns
- Invalid options are added for the division of 0 and any chance they give the invalid options it will terminate the operations

**Problem 2 (Odd Series):**
- I created for generate the odd number starting from 1 and print the exact number of odd number as the input given
- Here the the printing operations does not depend upon the typer of input wheather it is even or odd

**Problem 3 (Conditional Series):**
- I confused by this first but later i understood it is same as problem except it is depend upon the nature of the input
- check: if the input is even, the series length is reduced by one (`n-1`).
- that means if the input is even i.e 4 then only it prints n-1 terms of odd number that is it prints only 3 odd number starting from 1 

**Problem 4 (Multiples Count):**
- Uses a `Scanner` to allow taking desired input from the user
- Utilizes a `HashMap` to store and print the count of multiples for divisors 1 through 9.
- For memory management i cloesd the Scanner class
